# 2D Kalman Filter for Obstacle Tracking and Prediction for Automous Surface Vehicles 

## Author: Luca Chun Lun Lit
## Class: MATH 87 - Undergraduate Research as a Culminating Experience

This research was conducted under the supervision of Professor Alberto Quattrini Li, Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. I have worked closely and received a great deal of guidance from him, as well as Ph.D. student Mingi Jeong. 

### Description: 
This codebase generates a simulation of multiple-obstacle tracking and prediction using the 2D Kalman Filter. Applying this methodology to Professor Li's Autonomous Surface Vehicle, the ASV will be able to compute trajectories to avoid obstacle collisions. 

**Current state:** handling linear + non-linear motion with acceleration and angular velocity
